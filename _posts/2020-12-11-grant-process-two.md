### Grant Process Vol. II!!

Over the last few weeks, I have continued to develop my grant for a Neatline mapping project of the literary works of James Joyce. My general ideas for 
the project are the same as before, but since my last blog post, I’ve developed some further ideas about how I would organize the website.

My most notable discovery when exploring Neatline’s capabilities was the SIMILE timeline plugin, which changed my entire approach to the project. With 
the plugin, I was now able to not only map out the locations, but also create a timeline organizing the points in time these locations were visited. This 
is especially helpful given Joyce’s intense fixation with the accuracy of both time and place in his work. This plugin changed my idea of the website’s 
accessibility, which I revised. A prospective visitor would be able to look at the general map and click on individual locations for their entries. However, 
a visitor would also have the option to select a specific major character, which would take them to a separate, character-specific map organized by a 
timeline. These character map timelines would organize a character’s movements from location to location in chronological order, with each location having 
a corresponding entry.

The character map timeline idea also made me rethink the purpose of location entries on my map. In my initial experiences reading Joyce, particularly _Ulysses_,
I often found myself frustrated by the massive amount of information given in every scene, some of which would be relevant to later events and others not at 
all. The entries for the locations would serve to combat this problem by providing information on any recurring motifs in the work. For instance, Leopold 
Bloom in _Ulysses_ visits Sweny’s drug store at 10:15am on 16 June 1904, at which he purchases a bar of lemon-scented soap. Though the drug store scene 
is only a few pages long, the soap Bloom buys is a recurring detail all through the novel. The entry for Sweny’s, then, would note the first appearance of 
the soap and indicate that it recurs; subsequent entries on the timeline involving the soap would also acknowledge it, charting the arc of the motif. The 
end goal of this project, as I currently understand it, is a massive Joyce database that collects information (from primary and secondary sources) on the 
locations but also aids a prospective reader through identification of the many motifs.

Working on my Environmental Scan encouraged me to follow my ideas for the map because I have yet to locate any Joyce-related map that combines the two elements 
of mapping and timelining. The maps I have found contain many entries for locations, but provide no sense of temporal connectivity through a timeline. A 2018 
Google Maps project mapping _Ulysses_, for instance, gives the chapters in which the locations are visited, but provides no context of how characters got there,
or their relationship to the story as a whole. My project seeks not just to catalogue a long list of places but also assist in understanding the grand narratives 
of Joyce’s works.

For the CV/Resume option, I decided to go with a resume. Preparing a resume was actually tremendously helpful for me, as it gave me an opportunity to revise 
my resume and also practice tailoring it to specific applications!

The process of developing this grant proposal has been really fun and informative! Though it’s quite unfortunate that the project is hypothetical, this process
has given me insight into the necessary elements of a successful proposal.
