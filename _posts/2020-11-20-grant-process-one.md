### Grant Process Blog 1

My project is a Neatline mapping project of the works of Irish novelist James Joyce. Born in 1882, Joyce spent most of his formative years 
in Dublin, a city he eventually came to hate. In his early twenties, he and his wife moved to the mainland of Europe, where he wrote several 
of the most revered and controversial novels of the twentieth century. Even though he never went back for the remainder of his life, the city
of Dublin is central to every literary work he produced. These works, such as his short story collection _Dubliners_ (1914) and novel _Ulysses_
(1922), are notoriously dense because of the references to various places and people in Dublin. Joyce had a fascination with presenting his city 
as realistically as possible, so the places characters go all really existed in Joyce’s day; _Ulysses_ alone visits hundreds of streets and 
businesses. Without context, however, most of these references will go over a modern reader’s head. 

The recent advent of digital mapping softwares has opened doors in the world of Joyce scholarship. With the help of these softwares, it is now 
possible to construct digital maps that chart the locations in the novels. Some DH projects attempting a mapping of Joyce already exist on a smaller 
scale, and several have features that I would like to include in mine. A 2018 project on Google Maps mapping some locations in _Ulysses_ features them 
as dots on a map with a corresponding entry when clicked. Michael Gorden’s blog on _Ulysses_ features a section compiling labelled maps, though they 
are images and not interactive. My project can utilize a variety of scholarship, including maps of the city from the period, to chart the movements 
of individual characters not only in _Ulysses_ but in all of Joyce’s works. Ideally, it would include a function in which a user could browse the map 
by work of origin, or character (some characters recur in different works).

For this project, I looked into a number of different map-making softwares. Initially, I was thinking of working with the program ArcGIS, which I 
am familiar with from a DH project I worked on as a Summer Scholar. That project similarly involved map creation, so I researched ArcGIS again to 
explore any new features. I was particularly intrigued by the program’s recent StoryMap function, which I watched some tutorials on. With the StoryMap
function, a user can create a website with multiple maps, as well as present the information in a specific click-through order, akin to an exhibit. 
Ultimately I decided against using ArcGIS because I found some larger-scale programs.

The program I think I would use to write my grant is Neatline. The program describes itself as a cross of “archives and artifacts” through the usage of 
timelines and both modern and historical maps. I think this program would be ideal for my grant because of its easy accessibility and variety of features.
I am most interested in a plugin called the SIMILE Timeline Plugin, which adds a timeline feature to the map. The plugin is capable of tracking time in 
increments down to the second if so desired, which is especially helpful given that the entirety of _Ulysses_ is set in one day. Depending on the amount 
of entries included in the project, the timeline could also include historical background about Ireland, Joyce’s life, and the literary world at large.
