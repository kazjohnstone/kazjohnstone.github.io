### Coding Blog

For the last two weeks, I was required to do some coding in the Oxygen program for a transcription of "The Yellow
Wall-paper", a short story by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. Though the project seemed to be difficult and daunting at first,
I was guided through the process of coding gradually, which helped me an extraordinary amount. I was required to put in
a considerable amount of effort to learn the coding, but once I understood how it operated, I found myself pleasantly
surprised at how simple the work was. 

The first step in this process was done on Google Drive. My classmates and I were each assigned a particular column from
our .pdf file of "The Yellow Wall-paper" that we would eventually have to code into Oxygen. Dr. Stover transcribed the text
into a Google Drive document that was shared with each of us; she then had us make sure our respective transcriptions were
accurate by comparing them to the original .pdf file. It was crucial that the text was transcribed exactly as it appeared, even 
accounting for any spelling errors that existed within the text. Next, we were required to "annotate" our documents by highlighting
portions that we would have to encode when we moved to Oxygen. Since the majority of my portion was a conversation, most
of my document ended up being highlighted on account of quotation usage.
I thought this portion was easy, but I definitely had to go back and look for errors, as little things like em-dashes and
italics easily eluded me. When I was done, my document looked like this:

For the next portion, I was required to download Oxygen XML Editor, a coding program which I had never used before. In the 
program, we transcribed the text of the story using TEI, or Text Encoding Initiative, which is one form of XML. 
Learning TEI was a little bit tricky at first, because many different details in our writing were required to be encoded
in a specific manner in order for it to appear properly in the program's Author View. I found myself checking Author View
many times as I coded my column, to ensure that I was doing it properly.
I was also helped tremendously by the little colored box in the top right corner, which would inform me if there were any 
inconsistencies in my coding. (I certainly had to fix some errors on more than one occasion!)
My column was evidently one of the simpler ones, making prominent usage of quotes and one instance of italics, but that was
about it. In spite of this, however, Dr. Stover's in-class demonstrations, as well as the information she posted on the course
website, helped me to understand how to insert other features such as images, spelling mistakes, and illustrations.
