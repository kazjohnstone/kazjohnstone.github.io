Hello!

My name is **Kaz Johnstone** and I am currently a senior at CNU. I am an English major with a Writing concentration
and a Theater minor. 
I became interested in ENG 350 because of my ambitions in the field of writing; I am interested in writing of many 
different kinds, including research, journalism, and screenwrting. I determined that having an understanding of how 
the humanities have changed in response to increasingly digitally focused times is indispenable to my future success.

My minor in Theater has brought me a wide variety of experience in theatre arts. I have worked on four mainstage productions
at CNU, three as an actor, and one as a technician. Since last year, I have been a member of the Alpha Psi Omega fraternity,
the Theatre Arts honor organization on campus.

I also have some research experience! In the summer of 2019, I worked as a Summer Scholar with a professor in the English
Department. The project concerned literature of the Irish border
