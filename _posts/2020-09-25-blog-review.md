**Project Title**: The South Side Home Movie Project
**Project Directors**: Jacqueline Stewart, Sabrina Craig. Run by the University of Chicago
**Project URL**:  https://sshmp.uchicago.edu/

Stewart, J. and Craig, S. South Side Home Movie Project. Retrieved from https://sshmp.uchicago.edu/.

Started by the University of Chicago in 2005, The South Side Home Movie Project is a database that collects 
and digitally preserves home movies made by residents of Chicago’s South Side neighborhoods. The goal of this 
project is to build understanding of life in these neighborhoods and provide a medium for voices of their many 
backgrounds and cultures. The project hopes to ensure that these cultures and perspectives can be consulted and 
available for generations to come. The project receives funding from eight organizations from UChicago and elsewhere, 
including the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. 

The main page of the project is on the University of Chicago website, and follows its design. The website is quite 
accessible, with identifiable links to the digital archive, background on the team, events the project holds (showings, etc.), 
and a “Contact Us” page. The website also has a Trailer page, which features a YouTube skit introducing the project.

When one clicks into the actual database, the UChicago website design gives way to a simpler white layout. Within the 
Digital Archive of films, visitors are able to search by family last names, as well as to browse by Places, Subjects, 
and Years. The homepage of the archive has links to several different films which appear to be selected at random. The 
database is enormous, with home movies going as far back as 1929. 

Information on each film is organized very succinctly, with a chart for the identifier, a description, the date, the location, 
the format (of the film), the camera technique, and whether the film is silent or with sound. On the lower right side of the
screen is a map that indicates the general neighborhood the film was shot in. 

On the left side of the screen are clips of the home movies, with a queue for movies shot by the same family. 
Though some clips are available to watch in shortened versions, creation of an account is required to see all 
of the films, making accessibility difficult to a visitor. A critique I have about the site in general is its 
sheer size. While it is extremely impressive how much material the project has accumulated since its inception, it 
can be overwhelming. There is no sense of beginning or end when one enters the Archive, and while lists do appear
in alphabetical order, it is difficult to determine what to click on or search for.
